# Cutting a release

Two channels share one line of history. Which one a build lands in is decided
entirely by **the tag and the prerelease flag** — nothing else in the pipeline
infers it.

| Channel | Tag | GitHub release | Reaches |
|---|---|---|---|
| stable | `v1.4.0.5423` | **not** prerelease | AppImage · full.7z · AUR · Flatpak |
| alpha  | `v1.4.0.5397-alpha` | **prerelease** | AppImage · full.7z |

## Steps

0. **If the launcher changed, push its `alpha` branch first.** See below — this is
   the step that is easy to forget and produces a release that looks fine.
1. Commit the changelog entry and any version change.
2. Tag it. A stable tag carries no suffix; an alpha tag ends in `-alpha`.
3. Create the GitHub release for that tag — **and tick prerelease for an alpha.**
4. CI does the rest: `build-appimage.yml` builds and attaches the AppImage and
   `full.7z`; `publish-aur.yml` updates the AUR recipe. The Flatpak is monthly
   and self-updates, so it is not part of cutting a release.

## The launcher ships from its own branch

The launcher is a **separate repository**
(`ForkedInTime/keeperfx-launcher-qt-linux`), and `build-appimage.yml` clones it at
a fixed branch:

```yaml
LAUNCHER_BRANCH: alpha
git clone --branch "$LAUNCHER_BRANCH" --depth 1 "$LAUNCHER_REPO" launcher
```

Day-to-day launcher work happens on its **`master`**. So a release only carries
launcher changes if `alpha` has been fast-forwarded to `master` first:

```bash
git -C <launcher> push origin master:alpha
```

**Why this deserves its own step:** nothing fails if you skip it. The engine
release builds, every workflow goes green, the assets attach, and the changelog
describes launcher features that are not in the binary. It looks like the
features are broken rather than absent. This happened while cutting
`v1.4.0.5465-alpha`: `alpha` was six commits behind and the whole launcher
release would have shipped without a single one of its changes.

Two ways to confirm it worked, in order of effort:

- before tagging: `git -C <launcher> rev-list --count origin/alpha..origin/master`
  should be `0`;
- after the build: the AppImage run log should show the new sources compiling,
  e.g. `Building CXX object ... logviewerdialog.cpp.o` for the release that added
  the log viewer.

## Why the prerelease flag matters

GitHub defines `releases/latest` as *the newest release that is not a
prerelease*. Several things resolve through it:

- the README's download button, which promises the newest **stable** build
- `build-appimage.yml` and `build-flatpak.yml`, which fetch the previous
  `full.7z` from `releases/latest` to use as the payload base

Alpha releases were not flagged, so `latest` simply meant *most recently
published*. Because alphas ship far more often than stables, the next alpha
would have taken over that link — handing stable users an alpha, and building
the next stable's payload on top of an alpha's. All 27 existing alpha releases
were flagged retroactively on 2026-08-08; keep new ones flagged.

## The artwork is regenerated from FXGraphics on every build

Upstream keeps the game's artwork in a separate repository, `dkfans/FXGraphics`,
and its own alpha workflow regenerates every sprite sheet, texture and land view
from it on each run (`make pkg-enginegfx` and friends in `pkg_gfx.mk`). Their
stable release package carries the sheets as they were at release time.

Our payload used to take its `data/` from upstream's *latest stable release*,
while the engine in the same package is built from upstream's *master*. Any
upstream change that pairs code with new art therefore shipped here with the
code and without the art. Found 2026-09-26: upstream #5106 (13 August) added an
in-game Load/Save scrollbar drawn from six new `gui1` sprites; the July release
sheet has 239 entries, the code wanted 245, every log carried "Reserved button
sprite 239 has no matching entry in the loaded spritesheet", and a player with
more than eight saves got no scrollbar at all. Eight FXGraphics commits since
July were missing by then.

Both release workflows now run `make -f Makefile pkg-gfx` after building the
engine (it shallow-clones FXGraphics, about 930 MB, and fetches the prebuilt
Linux converters) and lay `pkg/data`, `pkg/ldata` and `pkg/campgns` over the
payload *after* the upstream release overlay. `-f Makefile` matters: a bare
`make` is forwarded to `linux.mk` by the GNUmakefile. The AUR data package is
cut from the release archive, so it inherits the regenerated artwork.

## Why the AUR only gets stable

`publish-aur.yml` skips any tag ending in `-alpha` or `-prototype`.

pacman upgrades on version alone. Before this filter existed, an alpha tag was
published to the AUR with its suffix stripped — `v1.4.0.5397-alpha` became
pkgver `1.4.0.5397` — so `yay -Syu` moved Arch users onto alpha builds silently,
indistinguishably from stable, at alpha cadence. The launcher has a
release-channel setting so a user can opt into alphas; a distro package has no
equivalent, so the filtering happens at publish time.

If Arch users should ever be able to follow the alpha line, that wants a
separate `keeperfx-tux-alpha` package they opt into by name — the usual Arch
convention — not a silent version bump.

## The stable-release trap: `latest` becomes the new release immediately

`build-appimage.yml` builds each release's payload by overlaying onto the previous
release's `full.7z`. It used to fetch that base from `releases/latest` — which is
safe for an alpha, because a prerelease never becomes `latest`, and wrong for a
stable, because publishing a stable makes it `latest` *the instant it is
published*, before its own assets exist. The build then tried to download its own
payload, got a 404, and `wget` exited 8 with no useful message.

This bit the first stable patch, `v1.4.0.5425`. The workflow now asks the API for
the newest **non-prerelease** release that actually carries
`keeperfx-linux-alpha-x86_64-full.7z`, skipping the tag being built, so it can
never resolve to itself — and still never bases a stable payload on an alpha's,
which is the rule the prerelease flag exists to enforce.

If you ever need the old manual escape: flag the new stable as prerelease, re-run
the failed build so `latest` falls back to the previous stable, then clear the
flag.

## A newer launcher for the current stable, without a new engine

Every stable ships `alpha`'s launcher with a stable engine. When the launcher gains
fixes between stables, the AUR can carry them to stable users as a packaging-only
release — same engine tag, next `pkgrel` — without cutting a new stable:

1. Merge the launcher work into the launcher's `alpha` (and fast-forward `master`).
2. On the **stable's own branch** (for 1.4.0.5660, `hotfix/1.4.0.5660`), bump
   `pkgrel` in `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` past the live one and set `_launcher_commit`
   to the launcher's new `alpha` head; update `.SRCINFO` to match.
3. **Give that branch `alpha`'s `publish-aur.yml`** if it does not have it already
   (`git checkout origin/alpha -- .github/workflows/publish-aur.yml`, commit). A
   hand-run publish runs the workflow *of the branch it is dispatched on*, and a
   stable's branch keeps the workflow it was cut with. Before 2026-10-11 that
   workflow rebased its bookkeeping commit onto `alpha` and carried on when the
   rebase stopped in conflict — then copied `packaging/aur` from the conflicted
   tree, conflict markers and all, to the AUR. It stayed harmless only while the
   committed recipe matched what the workflow regenerates exactly. `alpha`'s
   workflow stages the files before anything else, records the bump on the branch
   it was run from, aborts a rebase that conflicts, and waits until the AUR offers
   the new version. (`hotfix/1.4.0.5660` has it since 5660-3.)
4. Run **Publish to AUR** by hand on that branch (`workflow_dispatch`, ref
   `hotfix/1.4.0.5660`, tag `v1.4.0.5660`) — a dry run first:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run publish-aur.yml --repo ForkedInTime/keeperfx-linux-alpha \
     --ref hotfix/1.4.0.5660 -f tag=v1.4.0.5660 -f dry_run=true
   ```
   then again with `dry_run=false`.

Not from `alpha`: a stable's recipe belongs with its engine. `alpha`'s recipe has
moved on (it no longer lists `libepoxy`, which 1.4.0.5660 links), and the workflow
checks out the branch it is dispatched on. The workflow keeps the recipe's `pkgrel`
only when the recipe already records the version being published, which the
stable's branch does.

## The AUR bookkeeping step used to gate the AUR push

`publish-aur.yml` commits the version/checksum bump back to this repo and *then*
pushes to the AUR. That commit pushed straight at the default branch, so any
commit landing there in between made it fail — and because the AUR push is gated
on that step, the package silently never went out. The push is now rebased and
non-fatal; a failure warns and the AUR push still runs.

It also always went to the default branch, so a stable cut from its own branch
had its bump rebased onto `alpha`, which conflicted, warned, and recorded it
nowhere: `alpha`'s recipe went on saying 1.4.0.5652 after 1.4.0.5660 shipped. The
bump now goes to the branch the release belongs to — the branch a hand-run
publish was started from, or for a release the branch whose head is the tagged
commit (the default branch when both match) — and only falls back to the default
branch, with a warning, when no single branch fits.

## A green publish means users are offered it

The AUR's git repository has the new recipe the moment the push is accepted,
but the package information AUR helpers read can lag behind it by several
minutes. 1.4.0.5660-2 was accepted at 00:12 UTC on 2026-10-11 and `yay -Syu`
still reported "nothing to do" minutes later, which looked like a failed publish.
The workflow's last step now polls the AUR's API (every 30 s, up to 15 minutes)
until all three packages report the published version, and fails with a message
saying so if they do not. Re-running the workflow re-checks without pushing
again: the bump step re-pins the launcher to its current `alpha` head, so a re-run
after the launcher moved finds a recipe that differs from the AUR's at the same
version; when the launcher pin is the only difference it publishes nothing and
just re-checks (any other difference under an unchanged version still fails). By
hand:

```bash
curl -s 'https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc/v5/info?arg[]=keeperfx-tux' | grep -o '"Version":"[^"]*"'
```

## Ordering trap

`publish-aur.yml` pins the release's `full.7z` by hash, but that asset is
attached by the AppImage build, which runs *after* the release is published. On
a fresh release the archive is legitimately not there yet, so the workflow logs
a notice and skips rather than failing. Re-run it once the AppImage build has
uploaded.

## The save-format guard

A saved game is a raw memory dump of `struct Game`, and the engine loads one
only if its length equals `sizeof(struct Game)` for the running build. That
number is therefore the save format version, and a field added anywhere inside
any struct it reaches invalidates every save in existence — with no warning, and
nothing in the diff that looks like a save-format change. It happened on
2026-08-19 (`+ GameTurn last_turn_damaged` in `struct Thing`, ×12288 things) and
cost five campaigns in progress.

`build-linux-alpha.yml` now measures the size of the build it is about to ship
and compares it with `packaging/ci/save-format-baseline`; a mismatch fails the
release build. The same check runs on the weekly upstream-sync PR, which is the
direction the break came from. Run it yourself before tagging:

```bash
packaging/ci/check-save-format.sh
```

If it fails, read `packaging/ci/save-format-baseline` — the choice is to keep the
new state out of `struct Game`, or to accept the break by editing that file in
the same commit. Accepting it is a user-visible decision: it belongs in the
changelog, and the release body gets an automatic "saves from earlier versions
cannot be loaded" warning, written by the release build off that file's history.

## Build system

This fork builds with `linux.mk` only; upstream's CMake build is removed by the
Linux-only filter (README, "Why this fork builds with `linux.mk` only").

Syncing upstream no longer means adding their new source files to `linux.mk`
by hand: the weekly sync runs `packaging/linux-only/sync-linux-mk-sources.sh`,
which appends sources the team added and drops ones they deleted, and the
Linux-only guard fails a pull request whose list is out of date. Flags are
still ours to carry: #5099 also needed `-Isrc`, which upstream's Makefile has
always had -- a change like that still shows up as a red compile check.

## Upstream sync

The sync merges Linux-only snapshots of the team's tree, never their commits
(`packaging/linux-only/README.md`). Two rules follow:

- merge sync pull requests with a **merge commit** -- the next sync builds on
  the snapshot commit inside it, which a squash would drop;
- to sync by hand, `git merge "$(packaging/linux-only/make-snapshot.sh
  upstream/master)"`, never `git merge upstream/master`.

The build number (`packaging/linux-only/build-number.sh`) keeps the team's
numbering across snapshots; use it rather than `git rev-list --count HEAD`.
